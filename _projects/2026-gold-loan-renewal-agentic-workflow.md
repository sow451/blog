## Gold Loans in India

Gold loans are a thriving business in India, especially given the recent (2025-2026) gold price market rally. The industry of gold loans in India has seen high CAGR (20% for banks, 35+% for NBFCs). 

FYI: I spent most of 2025 building credit infrastructure and underwriting tools for the gold loan industry.

## Opportunity Noticed

While reviewing my client's loan books and getting to know their operational challenges, I came across the "rough estimate" of renewal loans being close to 60% of a typical NBFC's portfolio. What this means is that 60% of the client's loan book would be made up of renewals - internal and external.

Customers who avail gold loans can either take up an IBT (internal balance transfer) or an EBT (external balance transfer - where they move their loans from one NBFC to another.) I do not have the exact IBT/EBT split of this 60%.

## Hypothesis
NBFCs win if they can retain customers who would otherwise take up EBT at a competitor. 

In a rising gold price environment, every customer sitting on "appreciated" collateral is a live EBT target: a competitor can revalue their gold at today's price, lend a larger amount against it, use part of that to close the existing loan, and hand the customer the difference as cash. 

Today, this process of identifying at-risk customers and executing renewals is either manual or doesn't happen at all, leading to revenue leakage. Proactive IBT flips this from reactive to preemptive. 


## Agentic Solution: Proactive IBT 

An agentic workflow that:
-  Identifies, prioritizes, and converts gold loan customers who are at risk of leaving to a competitor via EBT. 
- Is measured against the 'North Star Metric': No. of customers lost to EBT(tracked MoM).

## Business Case

In our example: A fictious 8,000-customer book holds ₹245 Cr in collateral against ₹143 Cr in outstanding loans - ₹37 Cr of trapped equity that the company is not lending against but a competitor will. 

Industry data shows 30–40% of gold loan customers don't renew at maturity, and we estimate 20–30% of our book is specifically exposed to EBT: customers who still want a loan but will take it from whoever offers more money against the same gold. Further, a loss of renewal also impacts the CAC: LTV metric, increasing win-back and performance ad spend costs. 

P&L Impact: At an 80% recovery rate on EBT-exposed customers, Proactive IBT delivers **₹4.9 Cr in incremental annual income on a approx ₹25L build** — a payback period under one month. 

Proactive IBT in this case also moves from being a product-led growth initiative; to a customer retention and portfolio defence mechanism, with the added upside of generating significant revenue, alongside a projected **increase in renewal rate from 40 - 60% (industry standard) to 75%+**.
