This was my first ever coding project.

I followed a YouTube tutorial and built a simple Chrome extension that shows the Preamble to the Indian Constitution on every new tab. A friend had not heard of the Preamble, so I built it for him to get to know our Constitution a little better.

It is not published on the Chrome Web Store yet, but maybe I'll get around to it later this year.
