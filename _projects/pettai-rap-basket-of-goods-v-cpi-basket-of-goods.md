## Happy Birthday Malz
My best friend Malavika had a birthday this week. I've been thinking about her (and how much I miss living in the same city as her (she's in London)) and my mind wandered to the music, the in-jokes, the big ideas and the laughs we've shared together. 

One such piece of cultural zeitgeist we have in common, is the party trick of being able to rap Pettai Rap at any public gathering, perfectly on point. Pettai Rap is a rap song about life and money and never having enough, and the increasing cost of living. Its fabulous. 

Many years ago, when she and I both frequently worked on macroeconomic ideas, we discussed making a consumer price index that matched the song we both love. We started but never completed the project. 

A few days ago, I saw on the news that the Government of India, Ministry of Statistics had released its datasets through an MCP. Instead of going hunting through the various APIs, I could now ask a coding agent to match the goods from Pettai Rap to the CPI item codes and draw up a Pettai Rap Basket of Goods. So I did. 

Here it is.
