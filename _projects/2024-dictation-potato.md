_Dictation Potato_ is a spelling-practice web app built for repeat weekly practice.

I made this using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to solve a very specific problem at home: daily dictation practice was turning into a struggle.

The goal was to make practice feel more like a game and less like a test. Instead of me repeating words over and over, the app reads words aloud, tracks weekly lists, and lets us move through words one by one.

I connected it to a Google Sheet so I could keep updating the weekly spelling list without changing code each time.

## Why this project mattered

This one genuinely helped my son practice his dictation without tears. The routine became calmer, faster, and much more consistent because it felt playful.

## What I learned

- Building a kid-friendly flow with simple controls
- Using browser speech features for word playback
- Pulling structured weekly data from Google Sheets without a backend
