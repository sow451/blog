_Odd & Even Cat Sort_ is an unfinished concept game focused on number sense.

The idea: fish with numbers appear, and the player drags each fish to the correct cat based on whether the number is odd or even.

## Current state

- Game design and logic notes are drafted
- Planned mechanics and file structure are mapped
- Implementation is still pending

## Planned next steps

- Build the core drag-and-drop loop
- Add scoring + round completion logic
- Add visual/audio feedback for correct and incorrect drops
