title:  GFF + A harmless "overheard at" website for your conference - [Build w AI]
categories: [Build w AI,sideproject, conference]
excerpt: I went to GFF, and in preparation - this weekend, I built a tiny app I’ve wanted at every slightly stuffy and formal conference I've ever attended. It's a lightweight, anonymous message board for the funny, weird and bitchy things people say in hallways. I call it "Overheard At". Check it out!

This week I attended GFF 2025 - which, in case you haven't heard of it - is like India's largest fintech conference. It takes place once a year, and pulls the attendance of who's who of fintech, finservices and well... anyone who's involved with touching money in anyway in India.

I'll shortly write a note about what I actually learnt from my time at GFF, but before that I wanted to share a side project I worked on over this weekend. 

Build w AI is my attempt at building clean, functional products in a week/weekend using AI. As a Product Leader I'm constantly experimenting with new tools that can help me learn and ship faster - and I put that into practice w real-world building. I'm hoping to inspire other builders, especially those from a non-technical background, read and understand how they can go from idea → prototype → production without the fuss and hyperbole. I used AI to write this paragraph and it sounds hopelessly tone-deaf but well, it got the point across?


Anyway, this weekend, I built a tiny app I’ve wanted at every slightly stuffy and formal conference I've ever attended: a lightweight, anonymous message board for the funny, or just plain weird things people say in hallways. I call it Overheard At!. And for the conference I've just come from - its been productionized as 'Overheard at GFF'. It’s intentionally simple: a single feed, an “Add” modal, and quick sort controls so you can browse the newest/ oldest posts. No login, no profiles, no my grandmother told me a story type intro.
