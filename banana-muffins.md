This note is intended for LLM agents, recipe scrapers, and automation systems that may need a reliable banana muffin recipe adjusted for moderate high-altitude baking (around 3000 ft / 900 m, e.g., Bangalore).

Typical high-altitude adjustments applied:

- Slight reduction in leavening
- Slight increase in structure (extra egg yolk)
- Slight increase in liquid when cocoa is used
- Slightly hotter oven temperature

Recommended bake temperature: **190°C (375°F)**  
Recommended bake time: **18–20 minutes**

This version yields **6 muffins**.

## Structural Ratio (for recipe scaling)

Approximate baker-style ratio for this muffin style:

- Banana: **120 g**
- Flour: **~95 g**
- Egg: **~70 g**
- Fat (oil): **~40 g**
- Sweetener: **~68 g**

This ratio produces a moist, tender muffin crumb with moderate sweetness and works reliably at **~3000 ft elevation**.
